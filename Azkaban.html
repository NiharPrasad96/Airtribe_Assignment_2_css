        <div style="display: block;" class="message-container">
            <p>You wake up in your cold, dark cell in Azkaban, the notorious
                wizarding prison guarded by Dementors. The memory of your wrongful imprisonment burns in your mind as
                you realize there might be a chance to escape. Suddenly, you hear a faint voice coming from the
                neighboring cell. It's Sirius Black, your old friend and fellow inmate.</p>

        <div class="message-container"  id="listenToSirius">
            Sirius whispers his plan to you: "There's a secret passage hidden beneath the prison. We'll need to distract
            the Dementors and find the entrance together. Are you with me?" <br /> <br />
            <button id="agreeButton" onclick="showDivAndDisableButton('agree','declineButton');"> Agree and Follow
                Sirius</button>

        </div>
        <div class="message-container"  id="agree">
            With determination in your hearts, you and Sirius navigate the dark corridors of Azkaban, avoiding the
            patrolling Dementors. You finally reach the hidden passage entrance. As you step into the narrow tunnel, you
            can hear the sound of freedom beckoning you. <br /> <br />
            <button onclick="showDivAndDisableButton('continueAgree')">Continue</button>

        <div class="message-container"  id="continueAgree">
            Congratulations! You successfully escaped from Azkaban with Sirius Black. You are now fugitives on the run,
            but you're free. Your adventure continues as you evade capture and seek justice for your wrongful
            imprisonment. <br /> <br />
            <br /> <br />
        </div>
        <div class="message-container"  id="decline">
            You ignore Sirius's plan and begin to search for an alternative escape route. Unfortunately, without
            Sirius's guidance, you struggle to evade the Dementors and navigate the labyrinthine corridors of Azkaban.
            Eventually, you're caught by the prison guards and thrown back into your cell. <br /> <br />
            <br /> <br />
        </div>
        <div class="message-container"  id="ignore">
            You ignore Sirius's voice and focus on finding your own way out of Azkaban. You carefully observe the
            Dementors' patrol patterns and search for any weaknesses in the prison's defenses.

        </div>
        <div class="message-container"  id="continueAlone">
            Congratulations! With your quick thinking and resourcefulness, you manage to evade the Dementors and find a
            hidden passage leading to freedom. You successfully escape from Azkaban and begin your journey to reclaim
            your innocence. <br /> <br />
